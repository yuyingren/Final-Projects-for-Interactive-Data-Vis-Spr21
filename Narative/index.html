      <h5 class="subtitle1">Common and Uncommon Names</h5>

      <p>Let's continue on some interesting findings on the name trends in the United States! (the other part of this project is 
        <a class="link" href="https://yuyingren.github.io/Final-Projects-for-Interactive-Data-Vis-Spr21/Exploratory/">here</a>.)</p>
      <p>The two charts below are showing the distribution of <mark>common names</mark> and <mark>uncommon names</mark> in the polulation 
      that the social security administration office has recorded.<br><br>Before we look at the distributions, one noticeble thing is 
      the growing <mark>diverity of unique names</mark> in the US. In 1920, there are about 10,000 unique names and the number 
      has tripled to over 30,000 in 2019!<br><br>There isn't a standard rule to categorize common and uncommon names.
      However, observed from the national name ranking, the probable spliting line can be the line that seperating <mark>the top 10 percent 
      names</mark>. And the common names are that top 10 percent of the total unique names in each year.<br><br>But why is the top 10 percent?
      <br><br>The reason is that the top ten percent names occupied 85 ~ 90 percent of the population in each year, that is, about 
      90 percent of people who registered for social security are using the same small set of names that is only 10 percent of the 
      toal names in every year. The animation is demonstrating the distribution if female names, the male distribution is similar, change
      the selection to see the male names.</p>

      <h5 class="subtitle2">Odd or Regular Patterns</h5>
      <p>Now, with the background understanding of the common and uncommon names, let's discover something that are more interesting!<br><br>
        We all probably have heard some names that are popular all the time, like Mary, or some names that come to public with <mark>a slow
        growth</mark> and finally reach to the top rankings, like Emily. While these name are exceedingly popular but the reasons for their popularity
         is hard to track in the history. On the constrary, there are some names that catch people's eyes with an oddly growth of popularity.
         They probaly have a lower population, but their <mark>vastly growth of popularity</mark> in a such short time, can always give us a clear clue of
         the reasons of their popularity.<br><br>Name like the former kind, will be grouped as the <mark>regular patterns</mark>, which means they have a
         regular growth of popularity, by contrast, the later kind will be grouped as the <mark>odd patterns</mark>. As shown in the charts below, on 
         the left is an example of the odd pattern name <mark class="exp">Elsa</mark>, which has a sharpe growth in 2014 after the Disney moive Frozen came out in 2013.
         On the right is an example of the regular pattern name <mark class="exp">Chris</mark>, which is a unisex name but mostly used by male. Type any first name 
         that you are interested in the box below to discover its pattern!<br><br>I only included the common names that we defined in the 
         previous section, that is 6,800 names in totoal, if you couldn't find your name in here, then congratulation! Your name is very unique 
         in the US!
